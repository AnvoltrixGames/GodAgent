# Imported assets (sometimes people want to include these, but for a plugin, 
# you usually want to keep the .import files if they are needed for the plugin to work 
# however Godot 4 sometimes generates them for local development. 
# In a plugin, you MUST include .import files if you have textures/sounds.)
# So I will NOT ignore *.import if they are inside addons/
